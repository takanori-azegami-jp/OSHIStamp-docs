## Main Features

- **Insert Timestamps**

  Click the ⏱️ button while watching a video to insert the current time at the cursor position.

- **Change Timestamp Format**

  You can choose between the following two formats for timestamps:

  - Short format (e.g., 2:30, 1:45:15)
  - Full format (e.g., 00:02:30, 01:45:15)

  ※ When adjusting by ±1 second with shortcut keys(CTRL + SHIFT/ALT + ↑↓), the selected format is applied.

- **Jump from Timestamps**

  Clicking on a timestamp link will move the video to that time.

- **Fast Forward and Rewind**

  Use buttons to skip ahead or back by 1s, 5s, 10s, 1m, 5m, or 10m. Keyboard shortcuts (CTRL + SHIFT/ALT + ←→) are also supported.

- **Video Screenshot**

  You can download a screenshot of the video in "PNG format."

- **Generate Timestamp Links**

  Copy a link that starts playback from the current time to your clipboard with one click.

- **Copy Timestamps**

  You can copy the created timestamps to the clipboard with one click.

- **Check Current Time**

  View the current playback time on-screen in real time.

- **Video-based Auto-Save Function**

  Timestamps are automatically saved to local storage as they are created, so there's no worry about losing data during your work.

  Timestamps are saved independently for each video, allowing you to manage timestamps for multiple videos collectively. Additionally, you can jump to the corresponding video with one click from the saved list, enabling smooth reuse of previously created timestamps.

- **Backup and Restore**

  When changing computers, reinstalling browsers, or switching operating systems, we provide a backup function for timestamp data to ensure continuity.

  All timestamp data can be exported/imported in JSON format, making it easy to save and restore your work.

- **Color Mode Feature**

  Now supports Dark Mode.

- **Display Favorite Images**

  By uploading and displaying your favorite images on the screen, you can boost your motivation for "Oshi" activities!
